# tensorflow_tools
A set of tools to create data and define tf records in tensorflow for usage with the object detection tensorflow API: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection 

# Description

The development of this repo are the result of customizations to the code from the following github repo: https://github.com/datitran/raccoon_dataset. There is also an article related to this repository: [Objet detection with tensorflow API](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-train-your-own-object-detector-with-tensorflows-object-detector-api-bec72ecfe1d9). The section about tf records creation was used to understand the process of tf record creation and customize the scripts particularly to the transition from JSON label format to CSV.
